Kubernetes archiquecture

- Each node has multiple PODs

- There're 3 services required on every node
    - Container runtime
    - Kubelet: Interface between Node and Container to run configuration
    - Kube Proxy: Make sure the communication works

Architecture

- Master Node
    - Master processes:
        - API Server: a Client that allows to configure through command a line or UI, it's the main Entrypoint to the kubernetes 
        - Scheduler: See resources and go through Nodes and decide the best one to schedule - kubelet
        - Controller manager: Detects states changes and trys to restore Node state
        - etcd: Stores cluster state but not data from nodes, it's the cluster brain

    - There're always needed more than one, because if there's no master there will be no access to the Nodes
    - Are the most important process and use less resources
    - If there're many Nodes then more Master Node will be needed
    - It's easy to add them since it's only needed to install the services and add them to kubernetes cluster
