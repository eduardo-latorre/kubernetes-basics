Kubernetes components

NODE:
- Server where PODs are going to live 

PODs: 
- It's a set of containers
- Abstraction over containers
- Usually one app per POD
- Each POD gets its own IP address
- Can recreate if it fails and gets a new IP 

SERVICE:
- Permanent IP address
- lifecycle of POD and Service NOT connected
- Expose internally the POD using an DNS and IP
- Allows to connect to others Nodes if one fails
- It uses load balancers
- Fowards requests to other Nodes

INGRESS:
- Allows to use a DNS to forward to SERVICE as frontdoor

CONFIG-MAP:
- External config of your application
- Allows to set URLs externally from the Service
- Very useful when PODs gets an update, not need to re configure
- Must exist before deployments

SECRETS:
- Similar to CONFIG-MAP as an external config, used in PODs
- Used to stored secrets, passwords, tokens and certificates
- Need encryptions base64() as third party tools
- Must exist before deployments

VOLUMES:
- It's a remote or local STORAGE 
- For data persistence

DEPLOYMENT:
- It's for Stateless apps
- It's the app blueprint 
- Abstraction of PODs
- Able to set replicas 
- Able to scale up and down replicas

STATEFULSET:
- It's meant for DBs and Stateful apps
- Allows to avoid data inconsistencies
